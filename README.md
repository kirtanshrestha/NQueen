N-Queens Solver
===============

This is a console-based C# program that solves the N-Queens problem using backtracking. The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens may share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Features
--------

*   The program allows users to input the board size (minimum size of 4).
    
*   Utilizes backtracking to find all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem.
    
*   Outputs all solutions found with a visual representation of the board.
    

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

*   [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your system.
    

### Running the Program

1.  Clone or download this repository.
    
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the Program.cs file.
    
3.  bashCopy codedotnet run
    
4.  Enter the desired board size when prompted (minimum size: 4).

Code Overview
-------------

### Main Components

*   **Main Method**: Entry point that prompts user input for board size and initiates the solution-finding process.
    
*   **isSafe Method**: Checks if placing a queen at a given position is valid based on current board state.
    
*   **PlaceQueen Method**: Uses backtracking to recursively place queens on the board.
    
*   **DrawChessBoard Method**: Displays the board with queens in their current positions.
    

### Key Features

*   **User Input Handling**: Prompts user to enter a board size (minimum size enforced is 4).
    
*   **Backtracking Algorithm**: Efficiently finds all valid queen placements using recursion.
    
*   **Visual Output**: Displays each solution as a formatted chessboard.
    

Future Improvements
-------------------

*   **Input Validation**: Handle invalid inputs more gracefully.
    
*   **Optimized isSafe Function**: Improve the performance of queen safety checks.
    
*   **Enhanced Visualization**: Offer more detailed board display options, e.g., with colors or different output formats.
    
*   **Command-Line Options**: Allow users to pass board size as a command-line argument.
